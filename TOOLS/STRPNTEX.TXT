; This example is for the merging of palette containing 128 strip colours in its
; lower half with a pallete containing 128 texture colours in its upper half.
; Lines begining with ; or # will be treated as comments. Blank lines will be
; ignored. (Range is a count, starting at a Base value, rather than a maximum.)
